need to add simplify_check_cache for derivative(*,arb number of args). Currently this does not check the cache for equivalent values. Nor do any of the * simplifications get applied.

remove Logging from dependencies when done debugging

add function derivative_columns which accepts multiple variable arguments and computes just the columns of the Jacobian corresponding to those variables.

optimize set_diff to be non_allocating. Make it set_diff! and accept a BitArray arg.
